- Press the screen

The atom is programmed to be activated in either way. Once the screen is activated the selection of modes is possible

The thermometer has 5 different modes, represented on the screen of the atom by the number itself:

1. Show current temperature in degrees Celsius
2. Show average of last 24 hours of temperature in degrees Celsius
3. Color scale of temperature range followed by the current temperature 
4. Graph of the last 5 readings of temperature
5. Show current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
